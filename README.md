# Decentralized Shipment Tracking Dapp

## Overview

This decentralized application (Dapp) allows users to securely and transparently track products sent from a sender to a receiver. The project leverages blockchain technology to ensure security, transparency, and reliability in the shipment tracking process.

## Technologies Used

- **Smart Contracts**: Developed using Solidity, the smart contracts are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain to manage shipment-related transactions.
- **Web3.js and Ethers.js**: Used for interacting with Ethereum blockchain from the frontend.
- **React**: The frontend is built using React, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Metamask**: Integrated Metamask for wallet connectivity and transaction processing.
- **Hardhat**: Used for local Ethereum blockchain development and testing.

## Features

1. **Create Shipment**: Users can initiate a shipment by providing necessary details such as receiver, pickup time, distance, and price.

2. **Track Shipment**: Track the status of a shipment from the "Pending" state to "In Transit" and finally "Delivered".

3. **Payment System**: The application includes a payment system where the sender can make a payment for the shipment.

4. **Decentralization Benefits**: Leverages blockchain for decentralization, ensuring data integrity and transparency in the shipment process.
